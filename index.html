            Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Alexander Munson, a freshman studying Mechanical Engineering at North Dakota State University. 
            I would describe myself as a high-achieving student with a determination to learn and succeed. On top of mechanical engineering, 
            I am also pursuing a minor in robotics and computer science.
