            Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Alexander Munson, a freshman studying Mechanical Engineering at North Dakota State University. 
            I would describe myself as a high-achieving student with a determination to learn and succeed. On top of mechanical engineering, 
            I am also pursuing a minor in robotics and computer science.

            I grew up in Bismarck, North Dakota. Early on in my life I was exposed to alot of STEM through my Dad, and I think that fostered my aprecieation and love for it now.
            Growing up in Bismarck there wasn't really too much to do other than school, which definitely set me on the right path.
