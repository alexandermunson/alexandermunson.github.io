            Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Alexander Munson, a freshman studying Mechanical Engineering at North Dakota State University. 
            I would describe myself as a high-achieving student with a determination to learn and succeed. On top of mechanical engineering, 
            I am also pursuing a minor in robotics and computer science.

            I grew up in Bismarck, North Dakota. Early on in my life I was exposed to alot of STEM through my Dad, and I think that fostered my aprecieation and love for it now.
            Growing up in Bismarck there wasn't really too much to do other than school, which definitely set me on the right path.

            Now, I've found my way to NDSU. So far my time here has been tons of fun and super busy.
            Im a member of the bison robotics club under combat robotics, as well as the climbing club.

            A little more about me, I play the trumpet, a little bit of piano, and I love playing pool, longboarding, making cool stuff, and most of learning about whatever I can get my hands on!
